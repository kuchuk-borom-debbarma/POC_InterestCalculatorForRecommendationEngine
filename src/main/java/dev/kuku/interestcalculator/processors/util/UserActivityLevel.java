/**
 * What does it do? <br>
 * Calculates user activity level based on interaction frequency and patterns over time,
 * providing a normalized activity score that categorizes users as casual, moderate,
 * or highly active for personalized algorithm scaling.
 * <p>
 * Why do we need it? <br>
 * Different user types need different recommendation strategies - casual users benefit
 * from broader content discovery and trending topics to keep them engaged, while active
 * users prefer focused recommendations that respect their established preferences.
 * Activity level becomes a crucial scaling factor for cross-topic discovery, decay rates,
 * and content diversity algorithms.
 * <p>
 * Method: <br>
 * 1. Collect user interaction data over configurable time window (default: 30 days) <br>
 * 2. Calculate interaction frequency: total_interactions / days_in_period <br>
 * 3. Analyze interaction patterns: consistency, session lengths, content diversity <br>
 * 4. Apply weighted scoring based on interaction types to prevent low-effort actions from
 *    inflating activity scores - passive views get minimal weight while meaningful engagement
 *    (comments, shares, bookmarks) carries higher significance (view=0.1, like=1, comment=3, share=5) <br>
 * 5. Normalize to 0-1 scale and categorize: casual(0-0.3), moderate(0.3-0.7), active(0.7-1.0) <br>
 * 6. Cache result with TTL to avoid recalculation on every request
 * <p>
 * Example: <br>
 * User A: 150 interactions over 30 days = 5/day → moderate activity (0.5) <br>
 * User B: 10 interactions over 30 days = 0.33/day → casual activity (0.2) <br>
 * User C: 300+  interactions over 30 days = 10+/day → high activity (0.9) <br>
 * Result: Each gets different cross-topic discovery breadth and algorithm sensitivity
 * <p>
 * Benefits: <br>
 * - Personalizes recommendation algorithms based on user engagement patterns <br>
 * - Prevents overwhelming casual users with narrow, hyper-focused content <br>
 * - Respects active users' established preferences while still enabling discovery <br>
 * - Provides scaling factor for cross-topic influence, decay rates, and content diversity <br>
 * - Self-adjusting system that adapts as user behavior changes over time <br>
 * - Enables A/B testing of different strategies for different activity segments <br>
 * - Weighted interactions ensure meaningful engagement drives activity scores, not spam clicks
 * <p>
 * Calculated on-demand with caching, recalculated when activity patterns change significantly
