/**
 * What does it do? <br>
 * Builds and maintains weighted relationships between topics based on co-occurrence patterns,
 * creating a dynamic topic graph that strengthens bonds when topics appear together and
 * enables discovery of related content through both direct and indirect connections.
 * <p>
 * Why do we need it? <br>
 * Users don't exist in topic silos - someone interested in "CSGO" likely cares about "gaming"
 * and "esports" too. Without cross-topic relationships, recommendation systems become narrow
 * and fail to surface relevant content from adjacent interests. This creates natural content
 * discovery paths while avoiding filter bubbles by connecting related domains.
 * <p>
 * Method: <br>
 * 1. Extract topic sets from each piece of content (e.g., [game, csgo, meme]) <br>
 * 2. Create bi-directional relationships between every topic pair in the set <br>
 * 3. Increment relationship weights each time topics co-occur together <br>
 * 4. Apply logarithmic scaling with hard caps to prevent viral content dominance <br>
 * 5. Calculate indirect relationships through graph traversal (2-3 hops maximum) <br>
 * 6. Use weighted relationships to boost scores of related topics in user feeds
 * <p>
 * Formula: <br>
 * {@code bond_weight = min(ln(1 + co_occurrence_count) × scale_factor, max_weight)} <br>
 * where {@code scale_factor = 10} and {@code max_weight = 100} <br>
 * Indirect weight: {@code direct_weight × decay_factor^hop_distance}
 * <p>
 * Example: <br>
 * Content 1: [game, csgo, meme] → creates bonds: game↔csgo(1), game↔meme(1), csgo↔meme(1) <br>
 * Content 2: [game, gta, meme] → strengthens: game↔meme(2), adds: game↔gta(1), gta↔meme(1) <br>
 * Result: game↔meme bond becomes stronger (weight ~11), enabling meme discovery for game fans
 * <p>
 * Benefits: <br>
 * - Natural content discovery beyond explicit user interests <br>
 * - Prevents echo chambers by connecting related but distinct topics <br>
 * - Captures evolving topic relationships as content trends change <br>
 * - Logarithmic scaling prevents trending topics from completely dominating <br>
 * - Graph structure enables efficient relationship queries and recommendations <br>
 * - Self-organizing system that adapts to content patterns without manual curation
 * <p>
 * Storage: Graph database (Neo4j/Neptune) for optimal relationship traversal performance
 * <p>
 * Runs periodically to maintain graph health and recommendation relevance
