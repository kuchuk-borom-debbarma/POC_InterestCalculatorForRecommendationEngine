package dev.kuku.interestcalculator.processors.crossTopicBond;

/**
 * What does it do? <br>
 * Discovers and boosts related topics for users based on their existing topic preferences,
 * using direct relationship bonds to expand their interest profile and surface relevant
 * content from adjacent domains they haven't explicitly engaged with yet.
 * <p>
 * Why do we need it? <br>
 * Users rarely consume content in isolation - someone interested in "gaming" likely wants
 * to see "esports", "streaming", and "game reviews" too. Cross-topic discovery prevents
 * users from getting stuck in narrow content silos and enables natural exploration of
 * related interests. Combined with activity scaling, casual users get broader discovery
 * of trending related content, while active users with established preferences get
 * more focused recommendations.
 * <p>
 * Method: <br>
 * 1. For each user's existing topic with score > minimum threshold <br>
 * 2. Fetch direct relationships (1-hop only) from topic relationship graph <br>
 * 3. Filter relationships by bond strength > quality threshold (weight > 10) <br>
 * 4. Calculate boost score: user_topic_score × (bond_weight/max_weight) × influence_factor <br>
 * 5. Apply activity scaling: casual users get higher influence_factor for broader discovery <br>
 * 6. Add boosted scores to related topics in user's interest profile
 * <p>
 * Formula: <br>
 * {@code related_topic_boost = user_topic_score × (bond_weight/max_bond_weight) × influence_factor} <br>
 * {@code influence_factor = base_influence × activity_scaling_multiplier} <br>
 * where {@code base_influence = 0.4}, casual users get 1.5x multiplier, active users get 0.8x
 * <p>
 * Example: <br>
 * User has Gaming(80), Meme(60) <br>
 * Gaming bonds: CSGO(45), Strategy(30), Esports(25) <br>
 * Casual user boosts: CSGO(21.6), Strategy(14.4), Esports(12.0) <br>
 * Active user boosts: CSGO(11.5), Strategy(7.7), Esports(6.4) <br>
 * Result: Casual users discover more trending gaming content, active users stay focused
 * <p>
 * Benefits: <br>
 * - Natural content discovery beyond explicit user interactions <br>
 * - Prevents filter bubbles by connecting related but distinct interests <br>
 * - Activity-aware scaling matches discovery breadth to user engagement level <br>
 * - Casual users see more of what's trending in their interest areas <br>
 * - Active users avoid noise and get precise recommendations <br>
 * - Leverages community-driven relationship strengths for personalized exploration
 * <p>
 * Calculated during each user topic score update cycle
