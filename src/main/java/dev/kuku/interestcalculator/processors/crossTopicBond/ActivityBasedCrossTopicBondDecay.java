package dev.kuku.interestcalculator.processors.crossTopicBond;

/**
 * What does it do? <br>
 * Applies activity-aware decay to topic relationship bonds, where recently active
 * relationships decay slowly while stale relationships decay aggressively, ensuring
 * the topic graph stays current and relevant to ongoing content patterns.
 * <p>
 * Why do we need it? <br>
 * Without relationship decay, topic graphs become dominated by historical patterns that
 * no longer reflect user interests or content trends. A bond between "gaming" and "flappybird"
 * from 2014 shouldn't compete with "gaming" and "valorant" from today. Static relationships
 * prevent new trends from emerging and keep dead topics artificially relevant in recommendations.
 * <p>
 * Method: <br>
 * 1. Track last_updated timestamp for each topic relationship bond <br>
 * 2. Calculate days since last reinforcement (co-occurrence) for each relationship <br>
 * 3. Apply dynamic decay rate: recent activity = slower decay, stale = faster decay <br>
 * 4. Run periodic decay process (daily/weekly) across all relationships <br>
 * 5. Remove relationships that fall below minimum weight threshold <br>
 * 6. Preserve relationship metadata (created_at, total_occurrences) for analytics
 * <p>
 * Formula: <br>
 * {@code activity_penalty = min(days_since_last_update × 0.001, 0.05)} <br>
 * {@code dynamic_decay_rate = base_decay_rate - activity_penalty} <br>
 * {@code new_weight = current_weight × (dynamic_decay_rate ^ days_elapsed)} <br>
 * where {@code base_decay_rate = 0.98} and maximum penalty caps at 5%
 * <p>
 * Example: <br>
 * Gaming↔CSGO (updated yesterday): decay_rate = 0.979 (slow decay, stays strong) <br>
 * Gaming↔Pokemon (updated 30 days ago): decay_rate = 0.95 (moderate decay) <br>
 * Gaming↔FlappyBird (updated 180+ days ago): decay_rate = 0.93 (aggressive decay) <br>
 * Result: Active relationships persist, dead ones fade naturally
 * <p>
 * Benefits: <br>
 * - Self-adjusting system that adapts to content trends automatically <br>
 * - Recent viral content gets natural boost through slower decay <br>
 * - Dead relationships fade away without manual intervention <br>
 * - Prevents historical dominance from blocking emerging topic connections <br>
 * - Maintains graph efficiency by removing weak/irrelevant bonds over time <br>
 * - Seasonal content can re-emerge when activity resumes (Christmas, sports seasons)
 * <p>
 * Runs periodically or during cross-topic relationship calculation to maintain graph health and recommendation relevance
